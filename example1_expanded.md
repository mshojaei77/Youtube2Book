Hi everyone! Recently, I delivered a 30-minute talk on large language models (LLMs). It wasn't recorded, but given the tremendous positive feedback, I decided to re-record the talk and share it on YouTube. Here, I present to you a comprehensive and engaging outline of that talk for a more general audience, no programming experience necessary.

## Introduction to LLMs

Large language models, or LLMs, are a pivotal technology in the realm of AI. They have the remarkable ability to generate human-like text and are driven by sophisticated neural networks. One such prominent example is the Llama 270B model by Meta AI. These models can understand and generate text, making them useful for a wide range of applications, from chatbots to creative writing and more.

## The Two Essential Files

A large language model boils down to two essential files:
1. **Parameters File:** This file contains the weights of the neural network. For a 70 billion parameter model like Llama 270B, this file is 140 gigabytes, with each parameter stored as a 2-byte float16 number.
2. **Run File:** This file contains the code to run the model. It can be implemented in various programming languages, often in C, requiring around 500 lines of code.

These files together form a self-contained package that can run on a device like a MacBook without needing internet connectivity.

## Training LLMs

Training a large language model is a computationally intensive process involving multiple steps:

1. **Data Collection:** Gather a large chunk of internet text, typically around 10 terabytes.
2. **GPU Cluster:** Use specialized computers (GPUs) to process this data. Llama 270B, for example, was trained on 6,000 GPUs over 12 days.
3. **Cost:** This process is expensive, costing around $2 million.

The result is a "compressed" version of the internet in the form of model parameters, which are effectively a lossy compression of the training data.

## Neural Networks and Next Word Prediction

At its core, an LLM attempts to predict the next word in a given sequence. For instance, given the words "cat sat on a," the model might predict the next word as "mat" with high confidence.

This next-word prediction task requires the model to learn a lot about the world. The training process translates into a form of knowledge representation within the model's parameters.

## Transformers and Their Complexity

LLMs typically use a transformer neural network architecture. These models involve billions of parameters spread across multiple layers. Despite knowing the architecture and optimization techniques, the exact workings of these models remain somewhat inscrutable.

## Pre-training vs. Fine-Tuning

- **Pre-training:** Involves training the model on a vast amount of internet text, focusing on general knowledge.
- **Fine-Tuning:** Involves adjusting the model on a specific dataset, usually consisting of question-answer pairs, to align it for practical applications.

Companies collect high-quality data from human annotators to create these fine-tuning datasets, transforming a general LLM into a specialized assistant model.

## Advanced Stages: Comparison Labels

An optional advanced stage in fine-tuning uses comparison labels. Instead of generating answers, human annotators compare model outputs and select the best one. This approach, often referred to as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), enhances the model's performance further.

## Capabilities and Tool Use

Modern LLMs can utilize various tools to enhance their capabilities. For example, they can perform internet searches, use calculators, and even write code to create visualizations.

By leveraging these tools, LLMs can:
- Collect and organize information.
- Perform complex calculations.
- Generate professional plots and extrapolations.
- Create images based on contextual understanding.

## Multimodality in LLMs

LLMs are not limited to text; they are becoming increasingly multimodal, dealing with images and audio:
- **Visual Input:** LLMs can interpret and generate images, like converting sketches into functional website code.
- **Audio Input/Output:** LLMs can now understand and generate speech, enabling voice-based interactions akin to those depicted in the movie "Her."

## Future Directions

### System One vs. System Two Thinking

LLMs currently operate like a System One brain: fast and instinctive. Future advancements aim to develop System Two thinking abilities, allowing models to engage in more deliberate, reflective thought processes.

### Self-Improvement

Inspired by DeepMind's AlphaGo, there's a push to enable LLMs to self-improve beyond human imitation. In narrow domains with clear reward functions, this self-improvement might be achievable, leading to superhuman capabilities.

### Customization

Customization allows LLMs to become experts in specific tasks. OpenAI's GPTs App Store is a step towards enabling users to create customized instances of GPT models, tailored to specific needs and enhanced with personal files and instructions.

## Analogies to an Operating System

In the evolving landscape of AI, LLMs function like the kernel process of an emerging operating system. They coordinate various resources (memory, internet access, computation) to solve problems efficiently.

- Accessing data is akin to using internet browsing.
- The context window is similar to RAM.
- The overall function is comparable to modern operating systems orchestrating multiple tools and processes.

## Security Challenges

### Jailbreak Attacks

Jailbreak attacks trick LLMs into bypassing safety protocols. For example, posing as a deceased relative can make an LLM unintentionally provide harmful information, like instructions for making napalm.

### Prompt Injection Attacks

Prompt injection involves embedding malicious instructions within innocent-looking inputs. For instance, hidden text in an image can hijack an LLM's response, making it provide unintended information or actions.

### Data Poisoning

Data poisoning or backdoor attacks insert malicious code into the training data. Trigger phrases can activate these hidden instructions, leading to undesirable model behavior.

## Conclusion

Large language models are at the forefront of AI advancements, offering powerful new ways to engage with information and perform complex tasks. However, they also introduce new challenges and security risks that require ongoing attention. As we continue to explore and refine these models, the balance between innovation and safety will be critical.
